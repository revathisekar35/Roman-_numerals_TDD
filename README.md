# Roman numerals

This is a Java, Maven Project.

Created UML Diagram.

Implemented Oops concept and Junit Test case.

Followed Test Double Driven Approach.

This project will take numerical number as input and will give roman number as output and vice versa.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers other than this 1 to3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)
